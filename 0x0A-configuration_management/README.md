# 0x0A. Configuration Management

## Background Context

Configuration management (CM) refers to the process of systematically handling changes to a system in a way that it maintains integrity over time. Automation plays an essential role in server configuration management. It’s the mechanism used to make the server reach a desirable state, previously defined by provisioning scripts using a tool’s specific language and features. Automation is, in fact, the heart of configuration management for servers, and that’s why it’s common to also refer to configuration management tools as Automation Tools or IT Automation Tools.

Another common term used to describe the automation features implemented by configuration management tools is Server Orchestration or IT Orchestration, since these tools are typically capable of managing one to hundreds of servers from a central controller machine.

There are a number of configuration management tools available in the market. Puppet, Ansible, Chef and Salt are popular choices. Although each tool will have its own characteristics and work in slightly different ways, they are all driven by the same purpose: to make sure the system’s state matches the state described by your provisioning scripts.

## Note on Versioning

**Install puppet**

```
$ apt-get install -y ruby=1:2.7+1 --allow-downgrades
$ apt-get install -y ruby-augeas
$ apt-get install -y ruby-shadow
$ apt-get install -y puppet
```

You do **not** need to attempt to upgrade versions. This project is simply a set of tasks to familiarize you with the basic level syntax which is virtually identical in newer versions of Puppet.

**Install puppet-lint**

```
$ gem install puppet-lint
```

## Tasks

### 0. Create a file
Using Puppet, create a file in `/tmp`.

Requirements:

- File path is `/tmp/school`
- File permission is `0744`
- File owner is `www-data`
- File group is `www-data`
- File contains `I love Puppet`

Example:

```
root@6712bef7a528:~# puppet-lint --version
puppet-lint 2.5.2
root@6712bef7a528:~# puppet-lint 0-create_a_file.pp
root@6712bef7a528:~# 
root@6712bef7a528:~# puppet apply 0-create_a_file.pp

```

**Solution [0-create_a_file.pp](0-create_a_file.pp)**

### 1. Install a package
Using Puppet, install `flask` from `pip3`.

Requirements:

- Install `flask`
- Version must be `2.1.0`

Example:

```
root@9665f0a47391:/# puppet apply 1-install_a_package.pp
Notice: Compiled catalog for 9665f0a47391 in environment production in 0.14 seconds
Notice: /Stage[main]/Main/Package[Flask]/ensure: created
Notice: Applied catalog in 0.20 seconds
root@9665f0a47391:/# flask --version
Python 3.8.10
Flask 2.1.0
Werkzeug 2.1.1
```

**Solution [1-install_a_package.pp](1-install_a_package.pp)**

### 2. Execute a command
Using Puppet, create a manifest that kills a process named `killmenow`.

Requirements:

- Must use the `exec` Puppet resource
- Must use `pkill`

Example:

Terminal #0 - starting my process

```
root@d391259bf577:/# cat killmenow
#!/bin/bash
while [[ true ]]
do
    sleep 2
done

root@d391259bf577:/# ./killmenow
```

Terminal #1 - executing my manifest

```
root@d391259bf577:/# puppet apply 2-execute_a_command.pp
Notice: Compiled catalog for d391259bf577.hsd1.ca.comcast.net in environment production in 0.01 seconds
Notice: /Stage[main]/Main/Exec[killmenow]/returns: executed successfully
Notice: Finished catalog run in 0.10 seconds
root@d391259bf577:/# 
```

Terminal #0 - process has been terminated

```
root@d391259bf577:/# ./killmenow
Terminated
root@d391259bf577:/#
```
